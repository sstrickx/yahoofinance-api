/**
 * YahooFinance can be used to retrieve quotes and some extra information on stocks.
 * There is also the possibility to include historical quotes on the requested stocks.
 * <p>
 * When trying to get information on multiple stocks at once, please use the provided
 * methods that accept a <code>String[]</code> of symbols to get the best performance.
 * To retrieve the basic quote, statistics and dividend data, a single request can be sent to 
 * Yahoo Finance for multiple stocks at once.
 * For the historical data however, a separate request has to be sent to Yahoo Finance
 * for each of the requested stocks. The provided methods will retrieve 
 * all of the required information in the least amount of 
 * requests possible towards Yahoo Finance.
 * <p>
 * You can change the default timeout of 10s for requests to Yahoo Finance by
 * setting the yahoofinance.connection.timeout system property.
 * <p>
 * Please be aware that the data received from Yahoo Finance is not always 
 * complete for every single stock. Stocks on the American stock exchanges
 * usually have a lot more data available than stocks on other exchanges.
 * <p>
 * This API can also be used to send requests for retrieving FX rates.
 * <p>
 * Since the data is provided by Yahoo, please check their Terms of Service
 * at https://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/
